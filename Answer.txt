Question 1B
Estimated ATE (τ̂): -9.1057
P-value: 0.0004
Estimated ATE (τ̂)= -9.11: This means that after controlling for the sustainability spending (X), the treatment group has on average 9.11 points lower engagement score 
compared to the control group. The observed effect is statistically ignificant (p = 0.0004), exceeding the conventional threshold of α = 0.05

Question 1C
Assumption: Ignorability is satisfied, which means the decision to participate in the carbon offset program shouldn’t depend
on things that also affect annual sustainability spending (like profit, industry, or size). If participation is random or unrelated to those other factors, then we can trust the results.

Question 2C
Result:117.16
